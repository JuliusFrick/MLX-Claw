# TikTok Memory & Performance Log

## Best Performing Hooks (Data-Driven)

| Hook Template | Views | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| "My landlord wouldn't let me [ACTION] until I showed them [AI RESULT]" | 234K+ | Highest performer |
| "My [FAMILY MEMBER] wouldn't believe [ROOM] could look like this" | 167K+ | Strong |
| "I showed my [RELATIVE] what AI thinks our [SPACE] could be" | 147K+ | Consistent |

## Failure Log

| Date | Issue | Fix Applied |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2026-02-12 | Generated landscape images (1536x1024) instead of portrait | Always use 1024x1536 |
| 2026-02-12 | Text overlay 5% font size (unreadable) | Changed to 6.5% |
| 2026-02-12 | Vague prompts caused rooms to look different on each slide | Locked architecture in all prompts |
| 2026-02-12 | Self-focused hooks bombed (<10K views) | Switched to "other person + conflict" formula |

## What Works

- 6 slides exactly (TikTok sweet spot)
- Hook on slide 1 with text overlay
- Story-style caption (not feature list)
- Before room looks "lived in" (mugs, remote, TV)
- After room looks aspirational but realistic
- "iPhone photo" + "realistic lighting" produces best results

## What Doesn't Work

- Rooms without everyday items (look like show homes)
- Adding people to transformations
- Feature-focused hooks ("Our app does X")
- More than 6 slides
- Text hidden behind TikTok UI elements
