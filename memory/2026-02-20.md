## Slack Integration Setup

Julius configured a Slack app for Clawdbot:
- Separate service: `clawdbot-slack` (systemd)
- Home directory: `/root/clawdbot-slack-home`
- Port: 18800 (conflicts with main gateway on same port - uses bonjour to resolve)
- Mode: Socket Mode (not webhooks)

### Slack App Requirements
- Event Subscriptions enabled with:
  - `message.im` (for DMs)
  - `app_mention` (for @mentions)
- Socket Mode enabled
- Bot Token, App Token, and User Token configured

### Julius's Slack User ID
- `U09M8N13JPQ`
- Pairing approved manually by editing `/root/clawdbot-slack-home/.clawdbot/credentials/slack-pairing.json`

## Known Issues

### BlueBubbles Plugin Spam
- Config warnings flood the logs: "duplicate plugin id detected"
- Plugin at `/root/.clawdbot/extensions/bluebubbles/` conflicts with built-in
- Also missing `zod` module in the extension
- TODO: Clean up duplicate plugin registration
